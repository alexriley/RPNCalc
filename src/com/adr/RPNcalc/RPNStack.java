 * 	Description: extending Stack, which is a basic FIFO Stack, to include 
 * 	Reverse Polish Notation operators. Reverse Polish Notation is based on
 * 	the notation written by Jan ≈Åukasiewicz to create a parentheses-free 
 * 	mathematical notation. For example, the equation 8 + 16 in RPN would be
 * 	8 16 +. (In Polish notation it would be + 8 16). (21+7)*(6+2) in RPN is
 * 	21 7 + 6 2 + *. For more information, Google 'Reverse Polish Notation'.
